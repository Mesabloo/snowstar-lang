                <div>
                    Snow* is born out of ashes and pain in 2018.
                    The first version of the "Assembler" was made in 1 month.
                    The objective behind it was to prove that I, <a-link href="https://www.github.com/mesabloo">Mesabloo</a-link>, was able to create my own language, as I always was dreaming about.
                    Finally this idea came to my mind and the language got created after that, under an ASM-like syntax.

                <div>
                    Snow* is:

                    <span class="sep">Statically typed:
                        This means that anything you write is checked during compile time and not runtime, what makes the VM a bit faster to boot up.</span><span class="sep">Weakly typed:
                        The language has no explicit type specification. you can use a string mostly in the same exact context as a number.</span>
                    
                    <span class="sep">Pure shit:
                        Despite the fact that the syntax is pretty much self-explanatory, the way it works is sometimes really abstract, and it might also be totally confusing.
