            <div class="description"><div class="section">A little history about it:</div>
                <div>Snow* is born out of ashes and pain in 2018.
                    The first version of the "Assembler" was made in 1 month.
                    The objective behind it was to prove that I, <web-link href="https://www.github.com/mesabloo">Mesabloo<span class="info">https://www.github.com/mesabloo</span></web-link>, was able to create my own language, as I always was dreaming about.
                    Finally this idea came to my mind and the language got created after that, under an ASM-like syntax.

                <div class="section">Description of the language:</div>
                <div>Snow* is:

                    <span class="inliner"><span class="sep"><span class="title">Statically typed:</span>
                        This means that anything you write is checked during compile time and not runtime, what makes the VM a bit faster to boot up.</span></span><span class="sep"><span class="title">Weakly typed:</span>
                        The language has no explicit type specification. you can use a string mostly in the same exact context as a number.</span>
                    
                    <span class="sep"><span class="title">Pure shit:</span>
                        Despite the fact that the syntax is pretty much self-explanatory, the way it works is sometimes really abstract, and it might also be totally confusing.
